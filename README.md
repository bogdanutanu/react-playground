# react-playground

Simple React project, with all the tooling for building a bundle containing all the source code and 
dependencies into one single file, using **webpack**.

Just 

```
$ npm install
```

and then 

```
$ node run build
```

and you'll get the bundle.js file under public/.

Tested with node 6.2.2 and npm 3.9.5
